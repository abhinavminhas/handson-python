# Python - Variable Names

# Variable Names
'''
    A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).
    
    Rules for Python variables:
        A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
        A variable name cannot start with a number
        A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
        Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

# Multi Words Variable Names
    # Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
    # There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable.

    # Camel case
myVariableName = "John"

    # Pascal Case
MyVariableName = "John"

    # Snake Case
my_variable_name = "John"
