# What is a Module?
  # Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
  # A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

# Create a Module
  # To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py.

def greeting(name):
  print("Hello, " + name)

# Variables in Module
  # The module can contain functions, as already described, but also variables of all types (arrays, dictionaries, objects etc).
