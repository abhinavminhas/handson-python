# Python Syntax

    # As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line.

print("Hello, World!")

    # Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line.
'''
    python myfile.py
'''

print()
# Python Indentation
'''
    Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
    Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
    Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
'''
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
    print("Five is greater than two!")

    # Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.
    # Note - The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
    # note - You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error.
